## <a name="Usage"></a>Usages:
As a gift giver I feel at a loss for words when it comes to filling out a card, literally. Whether it be sympathy or a just because occasion, words just arenâ€™t my forte. I am able to save the card messages (via clipboard) and have the ability to access them through my profile which I can sign in and out of.
